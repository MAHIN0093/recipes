        Spicy mustard, smoky flavoring, savory spices, sweet soy sauce, and tangy lemon juice make up this favorite marinade. Once you make it, be ready for flavorful, juicy, zesty, chargrilled chicken breasts.

        This is the best chicken marinade for grilling! For tender, juicy chicken with a beautiful caramel color, this easy recipe is a must-try. Don't marinate the chicken for more than 4 hours, or the lemon juice will affect the texture. This is my fiancé's favorite chicken.

    <head><b>Steps</b> </head>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, liquid smoke, mustard, pepper, and garlic powder together in a large glass or ceramic bowl.

        <li>
            Place chicken in the bowl turn to coat with marinade. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours. Do not marinate longer than 4 hours.


        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

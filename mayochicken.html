    <p>
        Use up the rest of your mayonnaise and make this Mayo Chicken. Not only can you experience the umami taste of mayo, but it's also balanced with black pepper, rosemary, garlic, and salt.

    <p>
        This mayo chicken is my favorite chicken recipe, which I learned while doing low-carb dieting. I prefer dark meat, so I use 4 legs and thighs. You can make this recipe with pork chops as well.

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
